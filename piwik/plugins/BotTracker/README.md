# Piwik BotTracker Plugin 

## Description

BotTracker ist a plugin to track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawler, that hit yout page.

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, here's something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawler, spiders and bots don't load the images in a page and most of them don't execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don't use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.



Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It's free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Installation / Update

See http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

If you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\Updates\0.43.php) is not executed. In this case you get an error about a not existing column "extra_stats" when you open the config-page. Then you have to execute the following 2 statemnts on your Piwik-Database (e.g. with MyPHPAdmin):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `piwik_bot_db`
ADD `extra_stats` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `piwik_bot_db_stat`
(
 `botId` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `idsite` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `page` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 `visit_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 `useragent` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		 
 PRIMARY KEY(`botId`)
)  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```


The "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.
