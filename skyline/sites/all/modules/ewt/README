CoovaEWT Integration Module

http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaEWT/Drupal

This module does not come with the CoovaEWT application (JavaScript)
files, that is installed separately and is not released under the
GPL. But, this module does provide the Drupal integration - linking in
the CoovaEWT JavaScript application and providing an Ajax proxy to the
remote CoovaEWT enabled back-end.
